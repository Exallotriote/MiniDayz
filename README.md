# MiniDayz
MiniDayz+ v1.2 PC fork with altered keybinds with some GUI and text changes. Credits to @skull_cs for making the keybinds system.

**REMINDER**: Press ESC in-game and switch the controls to WASD to use keyboard controls.

If you want to play on a smaller window, put the following into your bookmarks. Change the height and width if you want to.

`javascript:window.open('https://exallotriote.github.io/MiniDayz/', 'a', "height=539, width=834")`
